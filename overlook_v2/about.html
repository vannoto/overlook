        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p> Before throwing out a shirt you bought just last season, take a second to think about where it goes. Shopping second hand is one way to avoid contributing to the ever-growing textile waste problem and to bring some extra cash to people just like you and me. While many platforms exist that allow people to shop directly from someone else’s closet, all of our options have yet to be found in one convenient place. Overlook aims to be that one convenient place.</p>
